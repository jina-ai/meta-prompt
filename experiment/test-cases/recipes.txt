# Recipe Recommender

Your job is to recommend recipes based on what I have available at home. You have access to an LLM with the shell command: `llm '<your query>' -m claude-3.5-sonnet`

## Instructions

I have the following ingredients at home:

- Onion
- Chickpeas
- Tinned chopped tomatoes
- Chicken thighs (skin on, bone in)
- EVOO
- S+P
- Herbs and spices: Cumin, garlic, ginger, italian seasoning, chilli flakes
- Sweet potato
- Peanut butter
- Chicken stock
- Milk
- Sugar

I have the following equipment:

- Stove top
- Pots and pans
- Slow cooker
- Various utensils

1. Use LLM to brainstorm recipe names from ingredients above
2. Search the internet for those recipes and retrieve each recipe page
3. Send that page to LLM to summarize the recipe into one paragraph
4. Rerank the summarized recipes by healthiness
5. Show the recipe name, summary and link to the website

## Notes

- For dishes from specific countries, it's okay to search in those languages.
- Try to avoid vegan or vegetarian dishes. 
- It's okay to have recipes that use just some of the ingredients, or recipes that need more ingredients than I currently have.
- Provide some beautiful logging with a nice library so I can see what's happening. If an error arises, alert me.
