Create a simple RAG system using pages from these sources:

- repo: https://github.com/jeff-dh/SolidPython
- wiki: https://github.com/jeff-dh/SolidPython/wiki (and all the subpages)

Scrape no other pages.

Instead of using vector database, use JSON file

You can access an LLM with the CLI command:

```shell
llm 'your prompt' -m claude-3.5-sonnet
```

After segmenting and indexing all the pages, present a prompt for the user to ask a question. To answer the question, find the top three segments and pass them to the LLM with the prompt:

```text
Based on these segments:

- {segment 1}
- {segment 2}
- {segment 3}

Answer the question: {question}
```
