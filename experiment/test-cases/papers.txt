# Paper QA

Create a Python script to:

- Using Jina's Search API: Search arxiv.org for the 3 latest papers with the search term "embeddings". When you have found a paper, log its name.
- Using Jina's Reader API: Scrape each paper's PDF and store the text and title
- Using Jina's Segmenter API: Break the texts into segments
- Using Jina's Embeddings API: Generate embeddings for each segment, using task_type retrieval.passage
- Allow user to enter a search query to search through the papers, using task_type retrieval.query
- Return each matching passage, along with the title of the paper.

## Notes

- Provide some beautiful logging with rich so I can see what's happening. If an error arises, alert me.
- Use the Jina API as described. Use no other libraries.
